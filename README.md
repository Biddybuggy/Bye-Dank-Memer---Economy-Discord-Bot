1. The .json file is to store user's data (regarding the amount of money they have in their wallets and banks, in addition to the items that they own).
2. Two aspects of the bot are still in development - a selling feature for the shop and a leaderboard.
3. You should type in your own paths for the mainbank.json file's path, the rickroll.txt file's path, and the jebait.txt file's path. My paths won't work on your computer.
4. There might be some bugs here and there, please inform me if you find one :)
5. You need to create your own Discord bot. Go to discord.com/developers/applications to do so.
6. In the last line, replace token with your bot's token.
